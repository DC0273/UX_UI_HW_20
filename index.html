                <p id="info">As a class project to redesign the popular radio broadcast, 
                npr. First we thing back to when newspapers were still around, 
                how many of us would skip straight to the sports section or the 
                weekly funnies, etc? Many of us have and would rather go 
                straight to the sections we have the most interest in. So we 
                want to implement a new personalized experience based on 
                the user’s interests, and add features to help cross promote 
                npr’s other great content. </p>

                <p class="card-text">We start with heuristic evaluation and we found 
                    the experience of npr’s site quite pleasant from a 
                    UX/UI start point with minor issues. But, what 
                    does the general public think? We discovered 
                    through usability tests that the current site is 
                    actually very intuitive and people found it clean 
                    and simple. So we decided to ask broader 
                    questions, to understand how the general public 
                    prefers to view their news, and how can we 
                    improve their news consumption. But first we 
                    must under stand the needs of the stakeholders. </p>

                great way to cross promote nrp’s other material people don’t get a chance to 
                see. By creating a personalized feed based on the individual will help diversity 
                the audience. Essentially “killing 2 birds with 1 stone.” In this case, 3 birds with 
                1 stone. Furthermore, adding a Listen Tab will cater to npr’s most engaged 
                audience by showing all the listening content. And finally, a Popular and Latest 
                tabs for those users who just want to get caught up on the news. I believe by 
                adding new features for the redesign will create a lasting and deeper 
                relationship for all users while increasing the time they spend with us and 
                creating multiple touch points.</p>
